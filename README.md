# Obsidian Customer Tracker Plugin

This plugin allows to keep track of every information you hear about every initiative for every customer in your territory.
It is intended for territory managers or any team manager that needs to keep an eye on the work their team has been doing, and ensuring no initiative is lost because it got unnoticed.

You can read more about the installation, configuration and usage in the [project wiki](https://github.com/jmmaldonado/obsidian-customer-tracker/wiki)

## Why this plugin ?
If you are like me, an obsidian heavy user - or an avid note taker for that matter, and a team manager with a tendency to forget everything, this plugin is for you.
I created it out of neccesity, at any given moment I am managing a territory of more than 50 customers, with tens of initiatives, so whenever I have meetings with my team and I get updates of the work they are doing I write lots of notes. Skimming through the notes is not an option, and searching while easy to do, is not very convenient to get the latest information. Furthermore, what happened to that initiative we started a while ago ? More often than not, the team is overloaded and it is just natural we pay attention to the latest initiatives and the old ones may fall through the cracks

I know the way everyone takes notes is very personal and my method may not suit you, I tried to be flexible and add some settings so you can make this your own, however it relies on a specific folder organization to understand what are customers and their initatives, and the team member updates.
